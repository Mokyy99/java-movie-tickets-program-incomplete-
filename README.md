 Developed a Movie Ticket Booking program in Java to centralize movie, show, and user management while
 enhancing the booking experience. This involved implementing robust CRUD functionalities for
 administrative control and generating comprehensive analytical reports on booking trends and revenue. The
 system also streamlined the booking process for receptionists and provided guests with convenient access
 to their booking history.
